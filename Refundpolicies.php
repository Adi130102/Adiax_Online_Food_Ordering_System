                    If you receive food that is different from your receipt, we sincerely apologize. Please call us at our restaurant(Adiax) as soon as you notice that there was an error in your order. You may come to pick up the correct food item.

                    For credit card payments, you will be refunded the sales price amount associated with the error.

                <p>
                    For cash payments, you will be asked to pay the difference of the balance if the new food has a greater value than the food received in error. In the same way, you will receive the difference of the balance back as credit for the new item if less than the food received in error. In some cases, we may offer you a store credit.
                    Your order will be priority if you come to pick it up. In all cases, please return the food order in the original container(s)* to our host.

                    We offer a choice of spice levels (Mild, Medium, Hot, and Thai Hot) but spice can be different for everyone. We usually suggest that you are on the side of caution and choose a lower spice level because you can add spice in, but can’t take it out! We do not offer discounts or refunds for a preferred different spice level, but please let us know if you’d like us to add a side of ground chili, chili sauce or Chilli flakes for you. Please note: for extra a side of ground chili, chili sauce or Chilli flakes, price starts from $0.50 & up)

                <p>
                    It’s possible your delivery partner might cancel the delivery if they’re unable to find or reach you. When they arrive at your delivery address, they’re prompted to contact you so it’s a good idea to keep your phone nearby when you’re expecting the food to arrive. If a delivery partner made a reasonable effort to contact you after arriving at your requested location, you may not be eligible for a refund.
